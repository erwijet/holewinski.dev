## Given Grace's concerns about spending a lot of her valuable time and energy in a study group, what would you say to encourage her to join?

There has been research showing that group-based learning can lead to high levels of knowledge acquisition, retention, accuracy, and creativity in problem solving. So even though you are investing additional energy into  the study group, its not just for socialization; it has a material impact on your ability to study, which may lead to less time needed to reach the same level of mastery had you studied by yourself

## What communication strategies should a study group use to ensure that members are satisfied with the group experience? 

Although a Collaborative strategy for a study group is ideal, since this group is entirely voluntary in membership and focuses on a single task at hand, it may be beneficial to employ the "Select Only One and Ignore the Other" strategy as needed, since avoiding tension is ideal and the task at hand is simple and straightforward. 

Additionally, the group should establish its goals in advance. This will help with group focus-- as issues arise, it will also serve as a grounding point for group conflict. 

## Which dialectic tensions are most likely to affect how well Grace and her study group achieves its goal?

Task Dimensions <=> Social Dimensions is most likely to be the dialectic most at play. This is because there will be a heavy influence to increase social dimensions since based on the Case Study, these are all people who are in a social environment and don't quite know each other, but are excited *to* get to know each other. In this case, it's essential for the study group to balance its energy on both the task at hand, as well as getting to know each other.

## Is it ethical for a study group to work together in order to improve their changes of earning a good grade when other students in the same class study alone? If yes, why? If not, why not?

A study group firmly falls under the principals set forth by the NCA preamble which emphasize sharing information, access to information. Additionally, study groups foster environments which are collaborative and promote understanding. Although the study group could diverge to behavior that isn't ethical, in general study group shave been found to be an effective source of education and knowledge share.
