## Two Essential Tools

**Verbal Communication**:
- How you use words and language to generate meaning.

**Nonverbal Communication**:
- Message components other than words that generate meaning.

## Verbal vs. Nonverbal

- Generally, verbal messages express the literal context of messages, while nonverbal messages express the emotional meaning.
- Some researching claim that we convey as much as two thirds of our meaning through nonverbal behavior

## High vs. Low Context

**High context Cultures**: put more emphases on nonverbal codes and interpersonal realtinoships to general and interpret meaning

**Low context Culture:** are where most people rely on word to general and intperr meaning of a messages

## Team Talk in Groups

- The language group members use as they work together to achieve group goal
- Language that reveals where the group is coming from and where it is going
- Language that build group relationships

## Use, I, You, and We Language

- **"I"**: Take responsibility for your feelings and actions, but don't overuse and appear self-centered
- **"You"**: Don't shift responsibility from yourself to others.
- **"We"**: Use inclusive plural pronouns; share credit for group achievements

## List Team Talk Techniques

- Use the pronouns *we, use* and *our* when referring to the group as its work
- Express shared rather than individual needs
- Ask group members to use your first name

## Assess Your Group's Team Talk

- Do members talk to one another on equal terms?
- Do members express empathy and liking?
- Do members use nonjudgemental language?
- Do members paraphrase one another?

## Levels of Meaning

**Abstract Words**: Refer to ideas or concepts that cannot be observed or touched such as *fairness*, *freedom*, and *love*.

**Concrete Words**: Refer to specific things that can be perceives by the senses. Concrete words minimize misunderstandings.

## Bypassing

- Miscommunication that occurs when people have different meaning for the same words and phrases.
- "Miss each other with their meanings"
- Example" I would like you to survey the group"
	- *Does this mean to simply ask members how they feel or to engage in a written survey for group members?*

## Exclusionary Language

- Demeans, inappropriately excludes, or sterotypes
- Poorly chosen words that can perpetuate discrimination
- Avoid language that stereotypes people based on their culture, race, religion, age, physical ability, sexual orientation, or lifestyle

## Jargon

- Specialized or technical language of a profession
- "Verbal shorthand that allows members to communicate with each other clearl, efficiently, and quickly" Many professions have this
- Members who are unfamiliar with a group's jargon are easily intimidated and frustrated

## Language and Gender

- Females tend to use language to reinforce relationships and promote cooperation
- Males tend to use language to exchange information or content
- Female speech more likely to contain qualifiers (maybe, perhaps) and tag questions (don't you think so?)
- Male speech generally more direct and forceful

## Nonverbal Behavior

- Facial expression and eye contact
- Vocal expression
- Physical Expression
- Environment

- Lack of eye contact may be perceive as rudeness, indifference, neverousness, or dishonestly
- Eye contact norms are culturally determined
- Eye contact influences interaction in small groups

## Physical Expression

**Kinesics**: the study of body movement and physical expression
**Touch**: can express encouragement, support, or happiness
- *Interaction between touch approaches and touch avoiders can create misunderstandings*

## Arrangement of Space

**Competitive Seating**: Face to face
**Cooperative Seating**: Corner-to-corner, Side-by-side
**More Interaction**: Roundtable
**Less Interaction**: Classroom seating

## Territoriality

The sense of personal ownership that is attached to a particular space
- Members who fail to respect the terrirory of others violate an imporant group norm

**Examples**:
