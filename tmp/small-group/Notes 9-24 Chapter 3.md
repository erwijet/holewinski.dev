## Schultz's Theory of Interpersonal Needs

Fundamental Interpersonal Relationship Orientation (FIRO):
- Need for **inclusion**
- Need for **control**
- Need for **affection**

### Need for Inclusion

**Social Member:**** a person who enjoys working with people but is also comfortable working alone.

- An *undersocial member* may feel unworthy or may withdraw from the group
- An *oversocial member* seeks attention to compensate for feelings of inadequacy

### Inclusion Needs

- "I need to feel accepted by the group"
	- "I feel accepted by the group" => Social Member
- "I don't feel accepted by or involved in the group"
	- "I won't participate much in group discussions" => *Undersocial Member*
	- "I try to gain the group's attention" => *Oversocial Member*

### Need for Control

**Control Need**: refers to the desire to feel competent, confident, and free to make decisions

- An _abdicrat_ is a group member who reacts to unmet control needs by being submissive and avoiding responsibility
- The *autocrat* reacts to unmet control needs by trying to dominate

### Need for Affection

**Affection Need**: reflects our desire to express and receive warmth and be liked by others

- An *underpersonal member* may establish only superficial relationships with other members
- An *overpersonal member* seeks intimate friendships despite the disinterest of other members

## Member Roles

**Role**: a pattern of behaviors with a member's specific functions within a particular group. Not just what you do; what members expect you to do.
Adopt different roles in different groups at different times.

*Task roles*: sets of behaviors that affect a group's ability to complete its work and achieve a common goal

*Social maintenance roles* sets of behaviors that affect how group members get along with one another while pursuing a common goal. Focus on building relationships.

## Group Task Roles

Seven essential task roles enable group to "get the job done". Overlap in these functions:

- *Coordinator*
- *Information Provider*
- *Opinion Provider*
- *Questioner*
- *Clarifier*
- *Analyzer*
- *Implementer*

## Group Social Maintenance Roles

Five social maintenance roles help members get along with one another as they persue a common goal. These roles can overlap

- *Harmonizer*
- *Motivator*
- *Supporter*
- *Gatekeeper*
- *Team Builder*

## Disruptive Behaviors

Some members consistently engage in disruptive behavior that may prevent a group from achieving its common goal. These member may have unmet interpersonal needs, hidden agendas, or poor communication skills.

> When members are highly disruptive, a group may lose its will to work and fail to achieve its common goal

- *Dominator*
- *Obstructionist*
- *Attacker*
- *Egoist*
- *Support Seeker*
- *Nonparticipant*
