## Establishing Group Goals

- If your group is assigned a goal by someone out the group, group members may not be inspired by or fully understand the goal
- However, if your group develops its own goal, members are more likely to embrace it and work hard to achieve it. 

## Goal Setting

**Effective group goals are:**

 - Specific
 - Challenging but realistic
 - Accepted by group members
 - Used to evaluate performance 
 - Linked to feedback and rewards
 - Allow for member growth

## Setting Goals

**Clarity**: Is the goal clear, specific, and observable if achieved? 
**Challenge**: Is the goal challenging, inspiring, and thought-provoking?
**Commitment**: Do members see the goal as meaningful, realistic, and attainable? 
**Compatibility**: Can *both* group and individual goals be achieved?
**Cooperation**: Does the goal require member cooperation?
**Cost**: Does the group have adequate resources (time, money, materials) to achieve the goal? 

## Hidden Agendas

- Occur when one or more members have undisclosed reasons for doing something that will benefit only individual members rather than the group as a whole.

## Types of Norms 

**Explicit Norms** are group norms that are written or stated verbally and shared with all group members. Often imposed by a leader or someone outside the group.

**Implicit Norms** are group norms that are rarely discussed or openly communicated by are still expected rules of behavior. Often not easily recognized by outsiders new group members.

## Types of Nonconformity

**Constructive nonconformity**: violating a norm while still supporting the group and its goal
**Destructive nonconformity**: violating a norm that negatively impacts the group and its goal

**Responses to destructive nonconformity**: 
- Accept 
- Confront
- Exclude

## Motivation

**Extrinsic Motivation**: where incentives come from external sources, such as a boss, family member, or role model. Rewards such as money or praise. 

**Intrinsic Motivation**: constitutes rewards that come from internal sources inherently in an activity. Rewards such as pride and sense of personal accomplishment.
