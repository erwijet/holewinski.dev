## Three Layers of Diversity

![[public/three-layers-of-diversity.png]]

## Homogeneous-Heterogeneous

**Homogeneous Group**: comprised of members who are the same or very similar to one another.

**Heterogeneous Group**: comprised of members who are different from one another

> *"The worst kind of group for an organization that wants to be innovate and creative is one in which everyone is alike and gets along too well"*

## Deep Diversity

Describes member characteristics that are difficult to observe, such as knowledge, skills, and abilities related to the demands of the group's task.

Members of deeply diverse and heterogeneous groups expand the range of possible solutions to a problem. 

## Ethnocentrism

Mistaken belief that your culture is a superior culture, with special rights or privileges that are or should be denied to others.

- "My culture should be the role model for other cultures"
- "People would be happier if they lived like people in my culture"
- "Most other cultures are backwards when compared to my culture"

## Stereotyping

A generalization about a group of people that oversimplifies their characteristics and results in erroneous judgements about the entire group of people.

- When we stereotype others, we rely on exaggerated beliefs to make judgments
- Although positive stereotypes may not seem harmful, they lead to unfair judgements

## Prejudice

Stereotyping leads to prejudice-- "negative attitudes about other people that are based on faulty and inflexible stereotypes"

- Word has two parts: pre- meaning "before" and -judice meaning "judge"
- Rarely based on extensive direct experience and firsthand knowledge

## Discrimination

Refers to acting out and expressing prejudice by excluding groups of people from the opportunities and right granted other people.

- Comes in many forms
- Discrimination has no place in groups
