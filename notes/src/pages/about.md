title: "About Tyler (hey, that's me!)"
---

Hello! In case it wasn't already obvious, my name is Tyler Holewinski. I'm a software engineer here in Rochester, NY. I sometimes go by `@erwijet` on the internet.

Right now, I am working at [Bryx](https://bryx.com), a public safety company where I develop SaaS products to help first responders. I've helped build Record Management Systems, Mass Notification Systems, dispatch software, CAD integrations, and much more. If you're curious, you can always check out my [resume](https://resume.holewinski.dev)!

I do a lot of reading and hands-on activities these days outside of work, but I've still got quite the backlog of project ideas kicking around. Sometimes I'll write about them and post them here! I really enjoy writing TypeScript and Kotlin, but recently have been enjoying Go and Rust a lot! I used to have purple hair so if you see an avatar with hair that's purple, know that there's a story behind it.

## Bookshelf

Here are some of the books I finished recently and really enjoyed! I keep telling everyone about them because I can't get them out of my head.

## Music

Here's some of the music I love! You aren't allowed to judge me, unless of course you think I'm super cool because of my music taste in which case, judge away.

## Trivia?

Some other random facts about me, for those who enjoy that sort of thing.

- I really love TI-84 calculators, long form video essays (s/o Jenny Nicoleson and Big Joel) and lego sets.
- One day I'll have a cat. I don't yet, but I will one day.
- Jasmine tea is the best tea, except for Constant Comment, which will reign forever supreme (sorry, I don't make the rules).
- I'm convinced teaching rocks to think was a mistake.
