Okay so I _really_ like [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly). I'm going to be quite critical of it, but I think it's a fantastic project. I myself in my earliest programming years remember tinkering with [MIT's Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), so block-based programming will always hold a space in my heart.

When I discovered the Blockly library, I was _so_ excited and had so many ideas of what to use it for. I had an 8 hour amtrak trip one weekend so I decided to dedicate my trip to getting a simple example working with Blockly.
